## Welcome

Hey, I'm <span class="dotted" data-toggle="tooltip" title="/fleɪˈmɪ/">Flamy</span>, and I'm an aspiring developer - but totally not a web developer.
I'm really fond of the [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org).

To be quite honest, I am not sure what the purpose of this website is going to be. Regardless of that I will try to keep it up-to-date with my projects.
Talking about projects, head over to the [projects page](projects) to get an overview of my humble selection of projects.
